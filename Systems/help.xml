  <text>Welcome to Antonov-22A heavy cargo airplane by HerbyW
    
	Autostart: press s and make the 2 additional settings!
		
		Manual start up:
		
		- Middle top panel: Right switch group: all in upper position: Battery, Lights for Instruments and NAV lights on.
		- Bottom middle panel: round knob for fuel in any right position - activates the tanks and pumps, a green lamp shows up.
		- 4 Engine starter switches above the fuel knob - one to four in upper position - starting the engines, each engine needs 17 sec for running.
		- Red lamps showing running engines, green lamps showing idle rpm.
		- Overhead panel: all switches in up position, power for navigation radios (ADF and VOR), compass and skawk.
		- Engineer panel: check red lamps going to green, then engines are ready to go, move throttle to idle position.
		- Check cargo and/or payload: press y to switch to the ramp control and open the red box, for loading cargo and paratroopers.
		
		Additional Settings:
		
		1. Reference Compass at engineer panel, magnetic variation is shown as tooltip, set needle to marker position.
		2. Altitude and/or pressure settings in the Altimeters in inHG, mmHG or hPa (as tooltip), the Autopilot will work with this values (not with the HUD-infos).
		
		Shut down: Fuel knob to left position or engine starter switches down.
		
		Failure training: you may shut down 1 to 3 engines during flight and try to land in emergency situation.
		
		Some instruments will show you metric values, some ft/knots.
		
		There is a 3 knob panel at the left side, marker volume, instrument lights and for rembrandt - cabin lights.
		
		The switch right from the Lights panel is for landing and taxi lights.
		Then there is the switch for activating the parachuters and a switch for the cargo door.
		Right from the Parachuters-switch is a switch for the new ALS lights, they are working only without Rembrandt and also not over the MP-modus.
		
		On the very left side you have a panel with 5 green lamps, the lower 3 are for trim-neutralisation, used after the Autopilot is dissabled.
		The upper two you may press to get the latest METAR infos on screen.
		
		Reverser initialisation by the switch at the throttle or key "Delete", a red lamp shows the activ reverser. Also a placecard "R" is comming up
		at top of the panel, the switch and the placecard can be used to deactivate the reverser. Any throttle change activates/deactivates the reverser then.
		
		The Autopilot Helper panel in the top middle console is fully working.You may use some instruments to put in the values:
		- Heading Control: Heading Bug (HDG) and Course of ILS (NAV) are to set in the HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator (with 4 green markers),
		- Velocity Control: Speed with Throttle are set in the Speed Indicator, push IAS and turn needle (left from HSI)
		- Pitch/Attitude Control is working if you get the plane in a climbing or descending position and push the Button VS, pitch wheel changes values.
		- Wing leveler is activ when you push the AP button, it is also the AP activating/deactivating Button,
		- APRP is used for intersepting the Glide Scope,
		- GPS for flying routes from the Route Manager,
		- ALT is holding your attitude.
		
		For ILS Landing you may use the HSI, it gives you the indication that ILS and/or Glide Scope is intersepted (if not, red flags comming up).
		ILS heading works even far out the stream, for the glidscope you should wait till the indicator is in nearly horizontal position (yellow line).
		
		Flaps Controll Panel with 6 Steps (1-2 for starting, 2-4 for landing without payload).
		
		Trails are now working only above 14000 ft, on ground it is not realistic.
		
		There are 3 Altimeters: the left one is electrical and gets the information from Radio or GPS signals, in meter and mmHG,
		the upper one is in meter and mmHG, a tooltip shows you the Value in hPa, the lower one is in ft and inHG,
		they are connected and you should set them to the ATIS information of the airport befor starting or landing.
		
		The compasses are cleared of the magnetic variation if you set the reference compass in the engineer panel to the orange marker position.
		
		On top of the horizontal heading indicator (HSI) there are indicators for fuel low (below 2500 l),over speed warning, over-loading, parking brake,
		outer, middle and inner marker, brake-chokes, decission hight and reverser.
		
		Paratroopers can be set up in the payload menue, each is 120 lb, they need a open back door to jump out, then use the switch on the panel to give
		the signal :)
		Bradley Tanks are now also loading, unloading and dropping with parachutes in MP-modus, press y to go to the ramp control panel.		
		You find some instruments in an additional panel, the middle instrument is for ground- and air-speed with a switch on the bottom.
		
		There is a warning light for overload on top of the compasses (sign: BEC).
		
		Radios, DMEs, ADFs and Kurs (ILS) Instruments are fully working and can be set in the Engineer-Panel.
		
		Liveries by eagle, for full effect: view-graphic options-shader options: model to higher position
		
		Rembrandt ready! Also everything is working fine without Rembrandt. ALS lights are also implemented.

	        Maximal start weight is: 551155 lb = 250.000 kg
